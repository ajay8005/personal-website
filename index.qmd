This page is hosted at [{{< var site-url >}}]({{< var site-url >}}). We could provide a templated listing of instructors here (or on its own page), similar to [DS100/fa23](https://github.com/DS-100/fa23).

Things are picking up now.

## Schedule

Here we use Quarto's EJS templating.

For a style similar to that of [Stat 20](https://stat20.org), modify `index.qmd` to point to `assets/{schedule-alt.ejs,buttons-alt.ejs}` and to `{schedule-alt.yml,buttons-alt.yml}` and `_quarto.yml` to point to `assets/styles-alt.scss`.
