## STAT 151A: Linear Modelling (Theory & Applications)

STAT 151A at UC Berkeley focuses on modern statistical inference and linear modeling, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Topics include:

-   **Matrix Formulation of Linear Regression**
-   **Hypothesis Testing for Linear Models**
-   **Model Assessment and Selection**
-   **Regularization Methods (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net)**
-   **Outlier Detection and Robust Regression**
-   **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**

Students learn to implement and interpret these models, assess assumptions, and address common pitfalls (e.g., confounding, omitted variables, high-leverage points).
